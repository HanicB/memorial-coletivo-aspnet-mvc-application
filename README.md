# About this project

- **Source**:
  - ASP.NET Core ([link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet));
  - Digital memorials: classifications and design recommendations ([link](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567));
 
## **Prototypes:**
System prototype ([link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658271.3658301)): Study with the artifacts (Requirements, prototypes, and tests) made for the system and published in an international conference.

## **Context:**
[ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) is designed to enable rapid evolution of runtime components, APIs, compilers, and languages while still providing a stable and supported platform to keep applications running.

[Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567) is an online platform dedicated to preserving and sharing memories, tributes, and information about individuals, events, or specific themes. Serving as a virtual space for reminiscence, a digital memorial can encompass a variety of media, such as photos, videos, testimonials, and documents, providing a multifaceted representation of the person or subject at hand. These platforms offer an interactive means for individuals to contribute their own memories, fostering meaningful and participatory connections in a digital environment designed to honor and preserve history.

[Collective Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567) When, in a digital memorial, the honored deceased people share a common bond. They can still be either a dedicated or an integrated memorial system. For example, the Memorial for the Coronavirus Victims in Brazil is a collective digital memorial integrated with the social network Facebook, and relíquia.rum is integrated with Instagram. On the other hand, “Inumeráveis” (2020) is a dedicated collective digital memorial, as it is presented on a website dedicated to the memorial.


## **Objectives:**
A collective digital memorial built with ASP.NET. The inception of this initiative traces back to meticulously crafted prototypes developed during a comprehensive research period spanning from 2021 to 2022. Currently in active development, this project aims to transform these prototypes into a robust and user-friendly platform for collective remembrance, capitalizing on the powerful features offered by ASP.NET.

This digital memorial represents a dynamic evolution from the insights gained during the research phase, incorporating refinements in design and the implementation of features to enhance the overall user experience. As a living project, it serves as an exploration of ASP.NET's capabilities in crafting meaningful and interactive web applications tailored for the preservation and sharing of memories.

By opening up this repository, I invite collaboration, feedback, and contributions from the community. Together, we can shape and refine this digital memorial project, contributing to the collective exploration of ASP.NET's potential in creating poignant spaces for reflection and remembrance.
